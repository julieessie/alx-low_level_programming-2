# Bit-Manipulation

This project looks into bit manipulation with operators such as &, ^, |, << and >>

Where & represents 'and' which means the result will always be 1 if both sides are 1
Where | represents 'or' which means the result will always be 1 if there is 1 on either side
Where ^ represents 'Xor' (Exclusive or) which means the result will be 1 only if one side has 1
Where ~ represents 'inverse' which means the output will be the inverse of the digit i.e. 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1
where >> shifts the number to the right according to the bits indicated
where << shifts the number to the left according to the bits inicated
